            <h2>About the 'C'-ntax (Syntax)</h2>
            <p>
                C++'s syntax is very similar to C's syntax since C++ is a successor of C. In fact, most C programs can be
                compiled using a C++ compiler. If a programmer wanted to, they could write C code in a C++ file and compile it as
                C++ code. The code will execute just fine. Though, doing this is frowned upon by many C++ programmers as they urge
                other programmers to stick with an unwritten standard. Most C++ programmers will see a C++ program using C-style
                semantics or overall style and will immediately call out the author to use the C++ STL or a C++ equivalent. I don't
                entirely understand why that is, but it seems that many C++ programmers are trying to steer away from C++ being
                derived from C and calling anything that's C-style bad.

            <p>
                As of C++20, there are 70+ reserved <a class="inTextLink" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword" target="_blank">keywords</a>.
                It's important to know these, since you cannot have a variable or function with the same name as any of these tokens.

            <h3>'Hello, World!': C vs. C++</h3>
            <p>
                Below are two "Hello, World!" programs. The first is written is C++ and the second is written in C.

            <p>
                As we can clearly see, both languages have a lot of similarities-- Especially since C++ and C both execute code
                from the <code>int main()</code> function; In this example, the only differences seem to be the directive to import
                <code>iostream</code> vs. <code>stdio</code> and the method for displaying to the console. Syntactically, from this
                example we are able to understand that C++ and C are in fact very similar and it's the main reason why many people
                refer to both languages when mentioning one of them ("C/C++").

            <h3>Fixed Size Containers: C-style arrays vs.
                <a class="inTextLink" href="https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/array/array/">
                    <code>std::array&lt;&gt;</code>
                </a>
            </h3>
            <p>
                C++17 introduced a new container, <code>std::array&lt;&gt;</code>, which is a C++-style array. It's a new way to create
                arrays in C++ instead of using C-style arrays. It's similar to C-style arrays, but it's more flexible and enables
                the programmer to use better use class member and global functions such as <code>::front()</code>, <code>::back()</code>,
                <code>::size()</code>, and so on. Below is an example of how to use the <code>std::array</code> container over a
                C-style array.
