                    Initially, developers saw C++ as just C with classes, but as soon as they saw
                    what C++ was capable of doing they realized how wrong they were.

                        C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup.

                    C++ was created as an extension of C.
                    Although C code can still be written using C++, C++ has tons
                    more to offer such as polymorphism, data abstraction, inheritance, and a standard library
                    with hundreds of algorithms. C++'s latest release, C++20, was released on December 15,
                    2021 and it introduced many new and exciting features such as modules, concepts, and
                    a new operator.

            <h3>Why You Should Learn C++</h3>
            <p>
                C++ is used commonly to develop operating systems, GUI-based applications, browsers, graphics,
                database software, and compliers. I personally believe programmers should learn C++ because it
                is an excellent language to enrich a programmer's knowledge on concepts typically abstracted away
                by higher-level languages. With C++, programmers manually allocate and deallocate memory from the heap,
                compared to other languages like Java were memory management is handled automatically by Java's garbage
                collector. In C++, programmers have can handle memory very specifically with pointers, which is another
                concept abstracted away in higher-level languages. Many programmers see C++ as a difficult language since
                they have to manually handle things that would usually be automatic, but I believe this is what helped me
                improve and really understand the computer science foundational skills.
