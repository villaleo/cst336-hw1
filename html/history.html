                        In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began developing on the project "C with Classes".
                        Stroustrup was motivated to create a new language when he was programming for his PhD thesis. He found that
                        <a class="inTextLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula" target="_blank">Simula</a> had great features for developing
                        larger software, however it was too slow for such practical use. On the contrary, he also found that
                        <a class="inTextLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCPL" target="_blank">BCPL</a> was fast but too low-level to be used for larger software
                        development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After Stroustrup began working in <a class="inTextLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Bell_Labs" target="_blank">AT&T Bell Labs</a>,
                        he ran into an issue and recalled his experience when programming on his thesis. This is when Stroustrup had the
                        idea to improve the C language with the notion to improve C by implementing Simula-like features. Initially,
                        Stroustrup's "C with Classes" modification added features to the C compiler, including strong typing, inlining,
                        default arguments, classes, and derived classes.

                        In 1982, Stroustrup began developing a successor to C, naming it C++. New features were implemented such as function
                        and operator overloading, constants, references, and virtual functions. In addition, Stroustrup also developed a 
                        compiler for C++, naming it <a class="inTextLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cfront" target="_blank">Cfront</a>. C++ has gone through
                        many changes and additions, with the most common version being ISO/IEC 14882:2017 (C++17). The latest version of C++ is
                        ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (C++20), which was approved on September 4, 2020 and published in December 2020.
